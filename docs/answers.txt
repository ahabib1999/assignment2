Branches give you the freedom to independently work on different modules and merge the modules when you finish developing them. Branches make it harder for unstable
code to be part of the main stable code so there's always a functional version of the project available to revert to.

The git log command displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and search for specific changes. While git status lets you inspect 
the working directory and the staging area, git log only operates on the committed history.

$ git log -- "./Vehicle.h"

$ git log --grep="file"

Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. Polymorphism is the characteristic of being able to assign a 
different meaning or usage to something in different contexts - specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one 
form. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

The Integration Manager worflow has centralized integration whereas the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow has distributed integration

The developers would benefit because the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow allows them to pull the latest conflict-free repo and make their changes. After making their
changes, the devs can just push their changes to the assigned Lieutenant repo who would the resolve some conflicts and merge changesfor some devs before the dictator 
merges changes from all devs and solves any remaining conflicts and pushes to the central repo. The devs can make changes without having to worry about conflicts.
